# Fitness Function for Feature Selection
# This function evaluates the performance of a given set of selected features on a dataset by training a specified model type and calculating performance metrics.
#
# Arguments:
# - selected_features: A logical vector indicating which features are selected for model training. The length of this vector should match the number of features in the dataset.
# - dataset: A data frame containing the dataset, including the target variable 'euro_d'.
# - train_index: Indices of the training set samples.
# - test_index: Indices of the test set samples.
# - model_type: A string specifying the type of model to train. Supported types are "rpart" (Decision Tree), "rf" (Random Forest), and "glm" (Generalized Linear Model).
# - fold_idx: An integer indicating the fold index during cross-validation (for tracking purposes).
#
# Returns:
# - A list containing:
#   1. accuracy: The accuracy of the model on the test set.
#   2. sensitivity: Sensitivity (True Positive Rate) of the model on the test set.
#   3. specificity: Specificity (True Negative Rate) of the model on the test set.
#   4. selected_features: The logical vector indicating which features were selected.
#   5. true_label: The true labels of the test data.
#   6. predicted_prob: The predicted probabilities for the positive class ("yes").
#   7. observations: The observed factor of the test data, used to compare against predictions.
#   8. PPV: Positive Predictive Value (Precision) of the model on the test set.
#   9. NPV: Negative Predictive Value of the model on the test set.
#   10. kappa: The kappa statistic measuring the agreement between predicted and observed classifications.
#
# Details:
# - The function first checks if any features are selected; if none are selected, it returns an accuracy of 0 and NA for other metrics.
# - The selected features are used to create a new dataset subset for training and testing.
# - The model is trained using the `train_model` function based on the specified `model_type`.
# - Predictions are made on the test set using `make_predictions`.
# - The confusion matrix is calculated to derive metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and kappa.
# - Returns a list of performance metrics and additional details about the model's predictions.
#
# Notes:
# - This function is designed for use in feature selection and model evaluation contexts, such as genetic algorithms or cross-validation.

# Genetic Feature Selection using Genetic Algorithm
# This function applies a genetic algorithm (GA) to select the best subset of features for a specified model type in the dataset. It evaluates different subsets of features across generations to optimize a fitness function based on model accuracy.
#
# Arguments:
# - dataset: A data frame containing the dataset, including the target variable 'euro_d'.
# - model_types: A character vector of model types to use for training. Supported values include "rpart" (Decision Tree), "rf" (Random Forest), and "glm" (Generalized Linear Model). Default is c("rpart", "rf", "glm").
# - n_generations: The number of generations for the genetic algorithm. Default is 50.
# - pop_size: The population size for each generation in the genetic algorithm. Default is 50.
#
# Returns:
# - A list containing:
#   1. best_features: A list of the best features selected for each model type.
#   2. best_accuracy: A list of the best accuracy achieved for each model type.
#   3. results: A list of data frames containing performance metrics (Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Kappa, PPV, NPV) for each fold of cross-validation.
#   4. thresholds_results: A data frame with performance metrics calculated at different probability thresholds (from 0.05 to 0.95).
#   5. ga_summaries: A list of summaries for the genetic algorithm run for each fold, including the best solution, fitness value, and iteration details.
#   6. all_predictions: A data frame with true labels and predicted probabilities for each fold and model type.
#
# Details:
# - The function performs 10-fold cross-validation for each specified model type.
# - For each fold, it uses a genetic algorithm to find the best subset of features that maximizes model accuracy:
#   - Uses the `ga` function from the GA package to create a binary GA, where each bit represents the inclusion (1) or exclusion (0) of a feature.
#   - The fitness function (`fitness_function`) calculates the accuracy of the model on the test set.
# - After GA optimization, the best subset of features for each fold is determined, and the model's performance metrics are calculated.
# - The function tracks the best overall accuracy and selected features across all folds for each model type.
# - Threshold metrics are calculated for a range of probability thresholds (from 0.05 to 0.95) to analyze the model's performance.
# Notes:
# - This function is computationally intensive due to the nested cross-validation and genetic algorithm optimization.
# - Set a random seed for reproducibility (`set.seed(1)`).
# - The `fitness_function` is called within the genetic algorithm to evaluate the selected features based on model accuracy.
